# SBK Clone

Welcome to the SBK Clone repository! This project is a replica of the SBK app, as I am applying and interviewing for a job as a frontend developer. I am very keen to join and so developed this app to showcase my skills and experience and that I am fit for the role as well as make myself stand out from other candidates.

## Technologies Used

- **React Native**
- **TypeScript**
- **Expo**
- **Expo Router**
- **Zustand State Management**
- **Reanimated Animations**
- Much more...

## Setup

To test the app you can go to the [SBK Clone](https://sbkapp.theblondealex.com/) website and test on your device.

## Remarks

- Due to time constraints there is limited functionality
- Lack of access to your assets means certain colours and images are not used
- For obvious reasons there is no backend
- With more time the code would be cleaner, more modular and more efficient

### This is very much just a taster of what I can do with React Native and what I could do for you!
